## What is this?

This repository contains some of the reports and homework I have written for class during my graduate studies.

Not really sure how reliable and accurate they are, but feel free to read through them or whatever.

## Writing in LaTeX

I write all my reports in LaTeX, as it is how big boys write. LaTeX is much more extensibe. Text files can be easily manipulated with Gnu core utils like grep, sed and awk. I can focus on the content itself, and let LaTeX take care of the formatting and bibliographies.
